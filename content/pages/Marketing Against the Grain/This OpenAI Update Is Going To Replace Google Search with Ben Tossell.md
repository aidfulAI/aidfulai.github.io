# Mini-summary

  + An AI like ChatGPT is superior in writing a text as you don't have to do the context switch: going to websearch, talking to colleague, ... The user interface is a massive improvement as everything can happen in one application.

  + AI will change that content is published because it is useful and not because people want users on their sites. AI will not give you the link but the answer in contrast to classical search engines. Therefore no benefit in the form of ad views or affiliate cookies by page visits.

  + You will create all your tools with AI in the future. There will be an audience of 1.

  + AI will become the purchase decider.

  + Current content is humans first machines, like crawlers, second. This will be flipped in the future.

  + [Ben Tossell]({{< ref "/pages/Ben Tossell" >}}) had the idea of his nephew being the hero in a kid books, illustrated with finetuned txt2img models. Two days later it was realized by someone else.


  + In the age of AI, people will trust people over brands.

  + Amazons Alexa is the largest network of AI access points.

  + It feels like this is monumental. I was trying to like, where

Kipp Bodnar  0:06

  + Like, you're kind of like, What the hell is happening here?

Kieran Flanagan  0:09

  + I was trying to I was trying to figure out is it the iPhone? Or is it the internet or maybe those two things are somewhat like maybe the I think the internet is like it has been more impactful than the iPhone but the iPhone wouldn't happen obviously with the internet, but like, This feels like the actual like changing of ways we interact with the Internet.

Kipp Bodnar  0:38

  + Today on [Marketing Against the Grain]({{< ref "/pages/Marketing Against the Grain" >}}) we have a very special guest we are joined by [Ben Tossell]({{< ref "/pages/Ben Tossell" >}}), who runs the daily AI newsletter. He's gonna be deep diving with us all about the next generation of AI that we are playing with today, which is GPT-3 chat from [OpenAI](https://openai.com). Let's get right to today's show.

Kieran Flanagan  0:56

  + Welcome everyone to another episode of [Marketing Against the Grain]({{< ref "/pages/Marketing Against the Grain" >}}) where we talk about how people and businesses grow in counterintuitive ways. This week, we have a really incredible episode we have Ben toss along who does the number one AI newsletter in my opinion, Ben's bites, he sold his company [Makerpad](https://www.makerpad.co) to [Zapier](https://zapier.com) and is going to tell us all about the things happening in AI this week. Ben, welcome to [Marketing Against the Grain]({{< ref "/pages/Marketing Against the Grain" >}}) .

Ben Tossell  1:19

  + Thank you for having me.

Kieran Flanagan  1:21

  + So let's start What the hell is going on? I spent the I've spent the last two days playing with [OpenAI](https://openai.com) new [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/). That is one of the things we definitely want to talk about, you had a really great thread on Twitter blew up has over 10,000 I think likes lots of engagement. I spent my first couple of hours trying to get it to help me break into my neighbor's house, which I actually thought was like, I'm never going to do this. And now I realized that people have figured out how to get past like how to turn off its ethics filter. And so you can actually do those things. But then why don't you just tell our audience what happened this week? What are you excited by? And like, how big of a thing is this? Because sometimes we're you know, we get carried away with ourselves and trying to get like a degree of like, is this big as it small? how impactful is this going to be?

Ben Tossell  2:08

  + Yeah, well, first, at the start of this week, DaVinci-003, was released to that open AI model of improvement on their DaVinci-002, which is what most people have been using. And I basically tweeted about that and said that, essentially every app that was built on GPT-3 got a software update overnight. So things like [copy.ai](https://www.copy.ai) [Jasper](https://www.jasper.ai) and things like that would use GPT-3 with the DaVinci 002 model. And then now that's been upgraded, things have got better, there's better responses, the prompting is a bit easier and things like that. So that was the Well, what we didn't know at the time, the smallest thing that was happening. And then of course, yeah, [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) for us came out two days ago now on the 30th of November, I think and it just feels like one of those moments where everyone the whole world's gone. Oh, shit. Yeah, I mean for everything. And yeah, we in the thread I just highlighted. I mean, this is basically what the email newsletter is I just highlight all the cool things other people are doing. And then I'm getting the praise for like bringing that to people's attention, which is a great position to be in at the

Kieran Flanagan  3:18

  + At the start of the week. I think people were getting a little confused on the DaVinci update where they were saying that this is GPT-4 upgrade between three or four maybe can you just like clarify that because I saw like a lot of tweets saying, oh, like we're going from three to four, four is going to be revolutionary. And then some people say no, that's not the update. It's really the DaVinci update. And what is the difference between those things.

Ben Tossell  3:38

  + So DaVinci 003 is not GPT-4, but GPT. Four is the new big model that is supposed to do so much more than what we can currently do with AI. And that's, I think it's supposed to be between sort of anytime now and February is supposed to be the release. And everyone's assuming because of the conference near IPS thing, as I said, that's going on this week. So everyone was thinking our open AI are gonna reveal it then. So DaVinci was just like an an improvement on their current model. So it was sort of is this three is a 3.5 Is this for is not four is kind of more 3.5. And then chap GPT came out and everyone's like, Oh, this feels more like what GPT four is going to be like, and I mean, they could turn around and say yes, this was GPT-4 we've been we sort of threw you off a bit, but it's hard to fathom that things are going to be even bigger and better. month or whatever.

Kieran Flanagan  4:36

  + I think hopefully not because I'm trying to still like figure out what my life is with these updates. So maybe you could start with just based on playing around with the new chat GPT which is opening eyes like an AI assistant like a bot that you can basically ask to do all sorts of things. What are some of the most interesting use cases that were things that you were like, this is way better than I thought it would be? shift this is like this is game changing versus because we've had some of these AI tools for for a while. But what are some of the things that you saw where you're like, oh, wow, this completely changes the way that I view this stuff.

Ben Tossell  5:10

  + One of the big pieces of using AI is like the interface of actually using it. So if you go to [Jasper](https://www.jasper.ai) or any of these writing tools, just sort of writing in a text document, and you're trying to get the AI to then generate things. And sometimes it can feel a bit clunky if you're trying to generate something just from your head. But if you're having a conversation with something, I guess, that almost feels like it's an easier, oh, follow up question. Oh, what happened here and chat GPT-3 can remember what's happened in the threads. So you can just have a conversation that then builds on the last piece, and a few things that I've seen, like even where you say, right, I want to write a blog post on insert topic here. And then you say, write a outline of all the sections that needs to have lots of the current writing tools can do that now. But this just feels like another level, because that would then give you the outline, you say, okay, great, that looks good. Can you write the first section for me and put it in Markdown? Because I'm going to use that when I put it over to my tool? It'll start writing that and then you say, actually, can you rewrite that section? And just don't mention this thing? And it will do that for you? And they say, okay, great. Move on to the next section. Move on to the next one. Can you add a code snippet here? Can you add, so and so here, like you can do lots of that stuff, you can say, give me sort of a numbered list here. So that was just much better than I've seen unused. Like in other writing tools, it just like added something extra that was like, Oh, I could I could write quite easily in that flow. And it's so much more than just felt more in the moment. So that's one.

Kieran Flanagan  6:47

  + Just on that point. But I think it's a really important point, which is one of the things that really struck me in terms of trying to parallel the way that I asked the AI assistant through chat to give me content. And the way I would ask Google is exactly what you said, it can actually you can refine your asks much quicker and much better. And so like a good example is I was comparing contrast, and just like really general questions. And so I said, Hey, like, give me some marketing tactics that I can use for a small business of a certain size that doesn't require any marketing budget and a list of that, like some pretty generic stuff, like but if you search on Google, you're gonna pretty generic stuff. And one of them was influencer marketing. And then I said, okay, like, talk to me about the do's and don'ts of influencer marketing. And I kept refining to the point that I asked the AI, could you write me an outreach email? So I can reach out to these influencers and convince them to actually work with me? And what can I like, and it's that refinement, that is like much better than the Google search experience.

Ben Tossell  7:47

  + **The work is not doesn't feel like it's on you. Whereas if you're using Google, the work is on you to go find the stuff, collate it, put together, refine it, and do all of that stuff. And people are lazy, people don't want to do the work around it. And the same, I think, when you're in that flow of I'm currently writing, and then it's going back and forth, and it the AI is writing for you. And you're refining you're tweaking, I'll actually actually want to reach out to the salespeople, like what would be a good opener for these kinds of people in this kind of background. And this kind of whatever I think just that whole user interface of it is, is a massive, massive improvement on what we've currently seen.**

Kieran Flanagan  8:27

  + It does not lend itself to Google's current monetization model. Like **at the moment, there's this kind of awkward relationship between Google and publishers, like we give you your content, and you give us some traffic back. Whereas open AI, it's somewhat changed that relationship completely. And I don't know how this is going to work long term, which is we give you our content, you learn from that give us the answers. But you don't you don't really give us anything in return. Because I'm not going to get traffic of that I get no really brand visibility of that.** One of the things I started doing whenever I asked her the question, I would ask it to cite its resources that backed up its claims, so I could see like the articles maybe it was pulling from but do you just think that's like technology is way ahead of copyright laws at the moment? Because the how do publishers get any value from that long term? Like what what's the, if this kind of experience becomes the search experience of choice, it's still somewhat reliant on publishers publishing some of that content. So we can learn from but there's no payback for publishing the same way there is for Google.

Ben Tossell  9:23

  + Yeah, it's a difficult topic, I think, because I can fully imagine the future is an address bar that you type start typing something into, it finishes off the sentence for you. And then it actually just finds the best information for you there summarizes it and gives it to you in that moment, it doesn't send you go to this link, view this blog post by this person and do that thing. And actually, it was called Blue coat, who he did a tweet that was like, This is what I think the future of search will be like is they'll finish it off and all of that stuff. So the problem is, Google's gotten in its own way a bit. Because none of us like Google search, like none of us actually like the experience of what we have to do need to go and find the thing. And even Google knows that to an extent, and it can't completely change its Google search the way it works, because that's their monetization model. That's where they get all their ad revenue from so you search and you search something, you want the link, you want the link, what is the top female investor, you want that the link to go to that person's Wikipedia or their, their personal site, you don't want to go? Okay, here's a list of results that have lists of female investors. So I now going into each of those and trying to do the research myself, I think it's going to be interesting, but I don't know. And hopefully, it actually means **that writing for writing sake to get traffic kind of goes away**. And it changes to be just useful information. And Google does this a bit with like, you can see the listicles that they they sort of promoted at the top of the top of the search result. Now if you search for something, there's a good example, I can't remember how to build an app, or whatever, it's something like that. There's, it'll show you it like sort of a semi extended abstract of a blog post, you don't need to go into the blog post to do that, it'll sort of give you a list there, which is kind of going this direction, but it is hoping that you're then gonna go and view that link. And people might still if the link is, like you said with the source, it says this information was pulled from this link and this link, you can then go and do more of that research.

Kieran Flanagan  11:25

  + But the reason someone writes that article that these models can learn from our use is because there's a pay, they paid back, I just wonder, like, why would I even bother? And then if I don't bother, how do they work long term, they're still somewhat relying on the publishers. **But Google's model has paid back for the publishers, but there's no payback for the publishers, then why even do it?** And I agree, I think part of the problem is, there's gonna be better monetization models for this tool. And that's not ads, but ads is probably the most profitable monetization model. So I don't know how Google navigates that. One of the other ones I know, I'm kind of being a really bad host, because I asked for things that you thought were most impactful. But one, I want to kind of just get to real fast, because I saw you tweeting about this as well. The one that really started to blow my mind was coding. People just write in, like Paki does not born, asked me to write a whole app that they could just like, take the code and use, like, was that incredible for you? Or did you find that like, pretty unbelievable? Or is this a known thing that it can code that easily through AI?

Ben Tossell  12:23

  + Yeah, well, I don't code. So something like this is interesting for me, because I never have been able to learn how to code. So I'm like, where do I start? Alright, where do I put that piece of code? Or what is what is this file? Where do I put this, like, what's my terminal? Those things you could ask in line to [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) as you're learning to code. So I think that is really incredible. But I did use [Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/), which is another model from [OpenAI](https://openai.com), which just write in plain English, it will generate code for you. So you say I want a web page with a form in that form, I want an input field. And then I want a button that says submits the input field needs to like take an email address. And then when this happens, when they click the button, this thing pops up. Like you can do that by writing in plain English, it'll generate the code and actually generate the app in front of you, which I've already already saw that. So I was assuming that that kind of stuff is going to come back up and resurface in another model, which it now has. And there's plenty of examples of people using code this way. So yeah, Pachi's example was, I want to build a web app. I think there's an AI web app on an AI summary app. So then [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) generated the code, and then a few bits of code that you did, you click Copy, and then you went to wrap it, which is like a in browser coding environment. You can literally just copy, paste, submit, Oh, I'm getting this bug. You put that in the conversation saying, I'm getting this bug, what do I need to do? And then it says, Oh, you need to change this to this. And then if you're saying, I actually, I don't want to, like, have cookies or something on the site, if you didn't want to do something, you could say that and it would say, okay, take this line out of the code. So your new code should look like this. Like it's just constantly iterating on things. I'm actually done it and have hired someone to try and do a really good tutorial of this, which is, can you build a website's purely using [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) and [Replit](https://replit.com) not knowing any code and literally typing an English copying and pasting can you build an app and before I got that tutorial back Pachi did that and I saw all these people. So the answer is yes.

Kieran Flanagan  14:33

  + Because what it means is, the biggest barrier for most people to come in builders, like there's probably like, you don't code. I actually did computer science at university. That's what I did. And I coded really badly and then give up because it was too hard. And so I don't code either. But I would love to have be able to build things. But the biggest barrier to doing that, for a lot of people is like the ability to actually code or learn the language. And so it feels like a lot of what AI is going to help do is unlock people's Korea. activity, because it's like the the barrier from going from creative idea to actual final product is not going to be the tool in anymore. And I think that part is going to be pretty unbelievable in terms of how we see like the evolution of all this, like what happens when we unlock all these kinds of creative ideas that people have, but have never been able to put into practice because they haven't been able to learn to learn or have been able to learn the software,

Ben Tossell  15:25

  + I think is pretty important actually. Like, I founded a company called [Makerpad](https://www.makerpad.co). And that's what I sold to [Zapier](https://zapier.com), and that is still running now. And that was no code education. It's basically because I couldn't code I figured out that you could use tools like web flow, and [Zapier](https://zapier.com) and [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com), stitch them together and build a membership site, for example. Now, the reason I did that is because I tried to code it didn't ever code I tried to code always hit the barrier of I just can't, my brain is not like I can't understand this. Secondly, write all this stuff. And then wait ages and see something come up and be like, right, I gotta go back to it. Is it that function is it that line, I can see a website, I can see where a button is, I can see how to round the corner, I can see how to like move it around. And it should be point and click. So that's what no code brought to us. And it really became a big, big thing of the last few years. And then now there's this. So I think there's like an evolution of coding, no coding, I don't know what the word is now. It's just you write it and then it can be generated for you. And I think that that is huge.

Kieran Flanagan  16:29

  + Yeah, text to code.

Ben Tossell  16:31

  + And it's also about like, the learning the education piece of that. And education as a whole really is, you can reverse engineer an app, or like you can write these things and try and figure it out. And you could basically just put those screenshots into a tutorial and say, like, enter this into [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) and then that will generate this code, then copy that to this, it's just, you can do so much with this, I just think it's going to be really, really powerful. And yeah, like you said, unlocking everyone's ability to do that is just a whole new, whole new wave of entrepreneurs being able to build stuff. And really the one, one thing I added, I've got little like Ben's thesis notes, **I can fully imagine a future where all {{< logseq/mark >}}internal tools are built by yourself for yourself{{< / logseq/mark >}}. So if I wanted a Chrome extension, that made sure, certain emails from certain people never gotten to my inbox or whatever, it's just something something silly like that, I can literally type that and say, Hey, I'd like a Chrome extension that does this, tell me how to install it, tell me how to unpack it and tell me how to run it on my machine locally.** Instead of me going and trying 1030 different tools and paying $10 a month for each and forgetting to cancel them and all of that sort of fast that you have to get to, in the time that it would take me to sign up for one tool, I could probably build that myself. Obviously, at the moment, there's still code involved, you have to copy it and deploy it and all of that stuff. But I can fully see a future where you are just typing these things, the codes being created for you. And you can install that internal tool, it's literally an audience of one built by yourself for the exact use case that you have

Kieran Flanagan  18:12

  + your build your own tech stack. What are the other things that is kind of mind blowing? If we think about where we've gone, like, okay, maybe a replacement for starch allows everyone to be a builder, because it really reduces the complexity of the code to just being able to like think of the thing, right, the thing, get the code. The other one I don't know if you've seen it, you probably have seen it, Ben, because I know you you have that you have your newsletter, I find a lot of my stuff actually in your newsletter. But one of the products that is really mind blowing, is [Adept AI](https://www.adept.ai), um, which is like an AI overlay on to all software. And so I can just interact, I never had to be have to use the software, again, like it's removing the barrier of having to learn to do any of this stuff. And now all you need is the idea to do that stuff. But you don't have you seen that? Like it's a Chrome extension that sets on products, and you can just type in what you want the product to do. And we'll do our thing.

Ben Tossell  18:58

  + Yeah, exactly. And I mean, that is one really big, obvious example of it, which is, hey, go find all these people go and enrich them with clear bit and then go and send them a mass like email with whatever you think is the best email to get to those people to convince them of insert topic. Like that could happen with something like this. But even that is another thing to have on a site. You could just sit there with [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) in the future and just type it and not even be anywhere else. Like these tools are thing I get about these tools it needs to be it needs to be in front of you needs to be where you are at the time. It doesn't. It can't be Oh, and you got to open that app on my menu bar or things like that needs to be really like in your flow to be able to be really effective and adapt I think is a really really like I'm waiting to get off that waitlist. I'm sure like everyone else signed up a few times now somewhere we don't even further down. But yeah, yeah, I really want to give it a go because that that kind of thing. I just think it just seems obvious. It seems like if you can tell me exactly what What to do and how to do it. Just one, I just want to say, Okay, do it then like, don't do it if you can do all these things, and maybe that's something that GPT-4 might unlock for us. We'll have to wait, I suppose.

Kipp Bodnar  20:10

  + Yeah, you been following up to the [Adept](https://www.adept.ai) conversation? What I what I would have to jump in with actually was, how do you think things like the GPT-3 chat and everything are going to impact design? And like, I was thinking a lot about like website design, you're talking about, hey, somebody can just come and have this chat interface, like on a website, it's like, how much of a website do you actually need? Then, if I could just ask this thing? How much this thing costs? And does it work for companies like me? All of these things? Like how does it fundamentally change in your mind, like what a website may look like or be in the future?

Ben Tossell  20:46

  + Yeah, that's a good question. Because it's a first thought you're going to just say, like, the actual design of the website, because I saw someone using [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F) to like, generate these landing page examples. And they were all looked like all of the landing pages at the moment. But yeah, I mean, you could literally see that, like, there's no need for scrolling. It's just like an input field, like a search box on every site. It has like a tagline that says, we do this speak. Like, it could genuinely be like that. And I don't know, what extent and where we are, and when that may happen, if it will happen. But it does feel like a pretty big thing to be considering. And like I was saying is, you might not even need to go on a website to find out the tool like you could just build a tool yourself by like conversing with  [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) and say, I want a tool that does this, can you get the code and install it on my machine for me and just set it up, you might not need to go to the sites to say, oh, I want to sign up for Buffer or whatever these these tools are.

Kipp Bodnar  21:42

  + So I think I think there are a couple of things interesting in there that I would unpack, which is like the first of all, you're talking about, like **consolidating the whole buying experience, right? Where you have all these stages, where it's like, oh, I go do some research, then I figure out what I'm going to buy. And then I go and set it up. You're like, oh, maybe maybe there's a day where AI will do all of that for you. And at that point, the second weird thing is that AI becomes the purchasing decision maker, not the human, right, because you're like, oh, I need to solve this problem.** And either AI comes back and says you should do this, or you should do these, one of these three are some kind of subset of things. Do you think we're ever gonna get to a point like that?

Ben Tossell  22:18

  + I'd love to not have to book a call or book a demo to find an enterprise pricing plan. So well, yeah, like that sort of stuff. Feels just it should be searchable. I think. I mean, I think we will get to that, to be honest. But I can't even imagine the rest of the world and all the knock on effects of Yeah, internet experience. And that's, that's what I struggle with to say yet, like, websites will be like this. Because then I can't imagine all the other ones are now redundant. Is that really what we're doing all day upgrade really all due to that

Kieran Flanagan  22:49

  + it can't recommend something that like, at the moment anyway, and I don't see how it can change and I get it See, I say what's the best I was trying to ask it? What's the best scheduling tool on it's like a I can't, I'm an AI tool, I'm not going to recommend the best one. But here are some ones. And I will still give me like five. And then I asked like, how did you get up, come up with these five? And I couldn't really figure out because it won't, it doesn't have access to like user reviews at the moment. It doesn't it's not it doesn't have access, like reviews or recommendations, because in a world that where it starts to recommend the only one like if you only have one, then that's a I don't think that's a great result for anyone.

Kipp Bodnar  23:23

  + No, let me try something. Let me try something on both of you and see if you buy it or you don't buy it, which is like today, the content and information we put out as companies is primarily for humans, secondarily for machines. Right, so cool. **We build this great website for our customers, then we make sure it's indexable by Google and Google can crawl it people can it can be discovered by by the current kind of technical infrastructure. Do you think in the future, there's a chance that we could flop that right where the you know, the majority of content we create is machine first customer second, where you've been? You were kind of getting at that where it's like, oh, it's going to incentivize people to have a lot more transparency and public information to feed feed AI feed the models?** Or do you think that is this like crazy talk and we're still going to be human first versus machine first? And like kind of the content we're creating?

Ben Tossell  24:12

  + Well, we'll always be human first. I think we will always have that on our side. Oh, yeah. The thing about the AI stuff is you're saying about like a product being recommended, and it being the only product but that will be probably the only product that would work for you. It will start learning what you like and yeah, you're willing to spend and how you like to spend your days if your meetings have fallen knew you had need like new podcast equipment or stuff like that. I think it would learn from a podcast similar to what you run. They seem to talk about the shore mic or the blue mic or whatever it is like I could see a world where that is happening. And I think this is true for all AI where everyone's scared that AI will take over everything. It's going to be like a sandwich and there's an article, I need to remember the name of it. That was really good. I put it on the email. thing yesterday. And it's like, we're all sorts of going to become directors where we start the input where the creative thoughts, and then AI does all the work, finds the reviews, writes the blog posts, whatever it is. And then we go in and refine the bits at the end and say, Oh, actually, I don't really want to spend 50 pounds on that I'd rather spend 200 pounds on that, oh, no, I need it today. Not tomorrow, like anything like that, I assume there's always going to be a touch point of human AI human. And that will probably be the interface. Well, that's what I can imagine is the interface of way of how we work with us. And the AI will learn things and recommend things and all of that I'm sure that.

Kipp Bodnar  25:38

  + The thing I'm most scared of, for everybody watching is that AI slows down human human change. Like if you just keep getting fed things you like, then you don't know like how to evolve and change as much like, I don't want humans to get too comfortable or too set in their ways of like, this is Oh, I like these things that I just get more and more of the stuff we'd like. Because that seems like a terrible existence for like, society. I don't know. Like, I'm way more scared of that then AI taking over the world.

Kieran Flanagan  26:07

  + Well, that's that's actually why I said I don't think it being able to recommend you the one thing is a good thing. It has nothing to skip. I think discovery for humans is an important aspect of like, learning, trying new things. It's a really important thing for having an I think a vibrant business ecosystem where you can discover new products and that you never even knew you wanted or you products that you didn't know existed. I guess like, it feels like this is monumental. I was trying to like, where is it?

Kipp Bodnar  26:39

  + Like, you're kind of like, fuck what the hell is happening here?

Kieran Flanagan  26:41

  + I was trying to I was trying to figure out, is it the iPhone? Or is it the internet? Or maybe those two things are somewhat like, you know, maybe the I think the internet is like, just more it has been more impactful than the iPhone. But the iPhone wouldn't happen, obviously, with the internet, but like, This feels like the actual, like, changing of ways we interact with the internet.

Kipp Bodnar  27:03

  + Maybe Web 3 isn't Web 3, it's AI.

Kieran Flanagan  27:05

  + This is what Web 3 wanted to be. Yeah, it is dude, like the you know, we don't need to get into an AI versus Web 3. But the one thing I will say is like, in terms of finding new use case, every single person on Twitter is seems to be using [OpenAI](https://openai.com).

Kipp Bodnar  27:26

  + Literally everyone is on a wait list for some tool.

Kieran Flanagan  27:29

  + It is currently down, because I'm trying to write a script in a Stephen King novel style to freak my friends out, and it's down, I haven't been able to do that. But what do you think, Ben? Where do you kind of rank this in terms of the evolution of you know, tech and humans where you put it and like, maybe round out with some of your the things that you think are going to happen in the next six months, twelve months that are going to be mind blowing for people?

Ben Tossell  27:53

  + Yeah, well, I think first, I think we will not we can always rely on humans to have an opinion. I love that it's us all being the same and having the same products. We couldn't even force that on everyone. If we want to do with AI, I don't think we'll get there because people just wouldn't have it. And I'm sure that AI will be built and trained. With that in mind, like it knows humans and what we do and what we don't do. It feels much. Yeah, it definitely feels like a massive technology shift like Cloud was, or the internet like it does feel like that it's difficult to be writing about it and showing off other people's stuff without thinking that and just thinking this has to be what everything is like every business, there is a like an add on, or some injection of AI that actually could make this better, make the people more productive or make something happen. I think I just I can't even predict if I'd be working on it, but I think the six, the six to twelve month thing is like, we're going to see a bunch of the exact same tool built over and over again. **I had this I had one idea for a storybook tool that would train on my nephew's face and would put him into a story with like dinosaurs. For the next day, I had a conversation with someone who had the exact same idea. And then the next two days or so full products that were exactly that.**

Kipp Bodnar  29:18

  + Well first of all, it gets back to our point from a previous of security that like going to market and distribution for the AI technologies is going to be what causes them to win because the back end differentiation currently today is low. And the time to build is low. It's so it distribution go to market knowledge is really high. And I think Ben just given your reaction and like how taken aback you are and we all are, I think it's safe to say that AI as we're going to see it is at least going to be on par with the mobile operating system in the web browser in terms of like level of impact on day to day user and in human behavior. It maybe it's bigger than that. Maybe it's the internet. I don't know, but it seems like it's at least On par with, you know, the iPhone OS, Android and like, you know, Chrome, Safari, all those things?

Ben Tossell  30:07

  + **Yeah, I think so. And I think in the age of like, which image is actually real, which blog post is human generated? I think that people are going to trust people over brands like people aren't going to go to a brand who might have generated AI content, but they might trust a person, if they're writing an email or something to say, this is over this. You're, you're building that trust with the person.** I think, if a Google or any of these other big companies come up with blog posts that seem like, Huh, what are they? What are they up to over there? Is that AI generated? I think there's going to be a lot of a lot of that happening. But I mean, I think AI is just a tool in everyone's tool belt that they should be excited about. It's like having Photoshop for designer, you don't know what images are photoshopped, you can tell some of them. But it's going to be a bit like that. And I think humans are always going to be in the loop. And it's going to be a human sandwich, I suppose in that in that sense of using AI?

Kipp Bodnar  31:01

  + Yeah, well, like I saw, I saw the kind of close out I saw, like the stupidest article yesterday, which is like how Amazon has failed with Alexa. And I was like, What are you talking about? **They have created the world's best network of AI access points. Like you can say, Alexa is not good enough. But are we gonna be surprised if they just don't swap that over to open AI or whatever the best back end is, and then they just have the perfect access point for, you know, kind of verbal AI that exists that it just I feel like we're in this transition phase.** And we're all seeing the world for what it was not the world for what it will be.

Ben Tossell  31:41

  + Yeah, that's just humans in general, and rightly so it's difficult to see what was passed. Like a new technology comes out everyone fights it and thinks that's just crazy. Like, we're not gonna be having robots in our house cleaning our female clothes and ironing bedsheets. But I hope so because I don't want to do.

Kieran Flanagan  31:57

  + The best thing about I do love how this stuff brings out human creativity, like the some of the stuff that I've seen people use it for, I just want to end with my favorite, which is, it seems like really obscure but this guy did. He asked it to write a script about someone arguing about the future of AI but who was secretly in love with this pumpkins, and couldn't go I could have stopped going on tangents about how much he actually loved. Lovecraft was just amazing that the guy's like, oh, yeah, the future it's going to do this and then it goes, but you want to see it this time and my pumpkins. I just anyways, okay, going back to Yeah, I like, I don't know, like it just it does. I do coming back to like the optimism the optimistic side of this is like it just unlocking people's creativity. Like there's so much creativity people and, and tooling is the problem. And I think that's going to be really interesting to see is like, how much cool stuff comes from people now that they, they can actually, you know, get to code get to tax all these things much quicker.

Kipp Bodnar  32:54

  + I think I think ideas and art and everything are gonna get better, not worse.

Ben Tossell  32:57

  + And we can all sit around on podcasts all day while the AI does the work. Yeah, so that's good, right?

Kipp Bodnar  33:03

  + Sounds awesome. This has been awesome. Ben, thank you so much for your time, and we'll see everybody real soon on [Marketing Against the Grain]({{< ref "/pages/Marketing Against the Grain" >}}).
