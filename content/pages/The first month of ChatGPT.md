ChatGPT is the name of a text-generating AI from [OpenAI](https://openai.com) which has the potential to change the world.

The AI is good at answering challenging questions. It can also generate programming code for stated tasks and be poetic or philosophical. The most impactful difference to earlier text-generating AI models is its ability to answer follow-up questions, which also allows to sharpen, shorten or reformulate an answer.

Everyone, who has tested it, is amazed. Everyone else needs to try it, to avoid being left behind.

Exactly one month ago, ChatGPT was released. This is a summary of what happened so far.

# Timeline

**Nov 30:** ChatGPT was released by OpenAI. The [launch blog article](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) states that ChatGPT is:

  + trained using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

  + free during the research preview

  + not always responding correctly

**Dec 5:** Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, stated that ChatGPT reached 1 million users after 5 days. This is faster than any other AI model, application, or technology:

**Dec 5:** Stack Overflow, so far, the most used site of many programmers, temporarily banned answers generated by ChatGPT. Besides being flooded with AI-generated answers, they might see ChatGPT as a threat to their business ([source](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421831/temporary-policy-chatgpt-is-banned)).

**Dec 6:** ChatGPT can manipulate spreadsheet data in bulk, making numerous data wrangling, scraping, and lookup tasks obsolete:

**Dec 7:** Summary video from [Yannic Kilcher](https://www.linkedin.com/post/edit/7014530662464372736/#) highlighting AI jailbreaks (circumventing ChatGPT safety restrictions) which are quickly patched away by OpenAI.

**Dec 10:** An [article](https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/10/openais-attempts-to-watermark-ai-text-hit-limits/) states that OpenAI was already in November working on watermarking AI content, as they state that it will become very difficult to identify if a real person wrote a text. The intention is to put a secret signal in the text to show that a text is AI generated.

**Dec 14:** Nick Milo shows three ways to use ChatGPT for note-making (not note-taking):

**Dec 15:** Update to "ChatGPT Dec 15 Version", which improves general performance and adds daily limit (experimental feature for some users) and conversation history ([source](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes)).

**Dec 18:** ChatGPT is used by Aaron Kemmer to write and direct a film:

**Dec 18:** There is no official API (application programming interface) for ChatGPT, and OpenAI tries to shut down the unofficial ones. However, [browser-based solutions](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api) are still working.

**Dec 20:** Even without using an API, tools are built on top of ChatGPT, like this chrome extensions generates summaries of YouTube video:

**Dec 22:** An [article](https://9to5google.com/2022/12/21/google-code-red-chatgpt/) states that Google is at "code red" after realizing the potential of ChatGPT to disrupt the web-search.

**Dec 28:** Fatih Kadir AkÄ±n releases a free e-book about ChatGPT based on his "awesome-chatgpt-prompts" repository:
