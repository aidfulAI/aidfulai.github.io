Kipp Bodnar 0:38\nToday on Marketing Against the Grain we have a very special guest we are joined by Ben Tossell , who runs the daily AI newsletter. He\u0026rsquo;s gonna be deep diving with us all about the next generation of AI that we are playing with today, which is GPT-3 chat from OpenAI . Let\u0026rsquo;s get right to today\u0026rsquo;s show. Kieran Flanagan 0:56\nWelcome everyone to another episode of Marketing Against the Grain where we talk about how people and businesses grow in counterintuitive ways. This week, we have a really incredible episode we have Ben toss along who does the number one AI newsletter in my opinion, Ben\u0026rsquo;s bites, he sold his company Makerpad to Zapier and is going to tell us all about the things happening in AI this week. Ben, welcome to Marketing Against the Grain . Ben Tossell 1:19\nThank you for having me. Kieran Flanagan 1:21\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s start What the hell is going on? I spent the I\u0026rsquo;ve spent the last two days playing with OpenAI new ChatGPT . That is one of the things we definitely want to talk about, you had a really great thread on Twitter blew up has over 10,000 I think likes lots of engagement. I spent my first couple of hours trying to get it to help me break into my neighbor\u0026rsquo;s house, which I actually thought was like, I\u0026rsquo;m never going to do this. And now I realized that people have figured out how to get past like how to turn off its ethics filter. And so you can actually do those things. But then why don\u0026rsquo;t you just tell our audience what happened this week? What are you excited by? And like, how big of a thing is this? Because sometimes we\u0026rsquo;re you know, we get carried away with ourselves and trying to get like a degree of like, is this big as it small? how impactful is this going to be? Ben Tossell 2:08\nYeah, well, first, at the start of this week, DaVinci-003, was released to that open AI model of improvement on their DaVinci-002, which is what most people have been using. And I basically tweeted about that and said that, essentially every app that was built on GPT-3 got a software update overnight. So things like copy.ai Jasper and things like that would use GPT-3 with the DaVinci 002 model. And then now that\u0026rsquo;s been upgraded, things have got better, there\u0026rsquo;s better responses, the prompting is a bit easier and things like that. So that was the Well, what we didn\u0026rsquo;t know at the time, the smallest thing that was happening. And then of course, yeah, ChatGPT for us came out two days ago now on the 30th of November, I think and it just feels like one of those moments where everyone the whole world\u0026rsquo;s gone. Oh, shit. Yeah, I mean for everything. And yeah, we in the thread I just highlighted. I mean, this is basically what the email newsletter is I just highlight all the cool things other people are doing. And then I\u0026rsquo;m getting the praise for like bringing that to people\u0026rsquo;s attention, which is a great position to be in at the Kieran Flanagan 3:18\nAt the start of the week. I think people were getting a little confused on the DaVinci update where they were saying that this is GPT-4 upgrade between three or four maybe can you just like clarify that because I saw like a lot of tweets saying, oh, like we\u0026rsquo;re going from three to four, four is going to be revolutionary. And then some people say no, that\u0026rsquo;s not the update. It\u0026rsquo;s really the DaVinci update. And what is the difference between those things. Ben Tossell 3:38\nSo DaVinci 003 is not GPT-4, but GPT. Four is the new big model that is supposed to do so much more than what we can currently do with AI. And that\u0026rsquo;s, I think it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be between sort of anytime now and February is supposed to be the release. And everyone\u0026rsquo;s assuming because of the conference near IPS thing, as I said, that\u0026rsquo;s going on this week. So everyone was thinking our open AI are gonna reveal it then. So DaVinci was just like an an improvement on their current model. So it was sort of is this three is a 3.5 Is this for is not four is kind of more 3.5. And then chap GPT came out and everyone\u0026rsquo;s like, Oh, this feels more like what GPT four is going to be like, and I mean, they could turn around and say yes, this was GPT-4 we\u0026rsquo;ve been we sort of threw you off a bit, but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to fathom that things are going to be even bigger and better. month or whatever. Kieran Flanagan 4:36\nI think hopefully not because I\u0026rsquo;m trying to still like figure out what my life is with these updates. So maybe you could start with just based on playing around with the new chat GPT which is opening eyes like an AI assistant like a bot that you can basically ask to do all sorts of things. What are some of the most interesting use cases that were things that you were like, this is way better than I thought it would be? shift this is like this is game changing versus because we\u0026rsquo;ve had some of these AI tools for for a while. But what are some of the things that you saw where you\u0026rsquo;re like, oh, wow, this completely changes the way that I view this stuff. Ben Tossell 5:10\nOne of the big pieces of using AI is like the interface of actually using it. So if you go to Jasper or any of these writing tools, just sort of writing in a text document, and you\u0026rsquo;re trying to get the AI to then generate things. And sometimes it can feel a bit clunky if you\u0026rsquo;re trying to generate something just from your head. But if you\u0026rsquo;re having a conversation with something, I guess, that almost feels like it\u0026rsquo;s an easier, oh, follow up question. Oh, what happened here and chat GPT-3 can remember what\u0026rsquo;s happened in the threads. So you can just have a conversation that then builds on the last piece, and a few things that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen, like even where you say, right, I want to write a blog post on insert topic here. And then you say, write a outline of all the sections that needs to have lots of the current writing tools can do that now. But this just feels like another level, because that would then give you the outline, you say, okay, great, that looks good. Can you write the first section for me and put it in Markdown? Because I\u0026rsquo;m going to use that when I put it over to my tool? It\u0026rsquo;ll start writing that and then you say, actually, can you rewrite that section? And just don\u0026rsquo;t mention this thing? And it will do that for you? And they say, okay, great. Move on to the next section. Move on to the next one. Can you add a code snippet here? Can you add, so and so here, like you can do lots of that stuff, you can say, give me sort of a numbered list here. So that was just much better than I\u0026rsquo;ve seen unused. Like in other writing tools, it just like added something extra that was like, Oh, I could I could write quite easily in that flow. And it\u0026rsquo;s so much more than just felt more in the moment. So that\u0026rsquo;s one. Kieran Flanagan 6:47\nJust on that point. But I think it\u0026rsquo;s a really important point, which is one of the things that really struck me in terms of trying to parallel the way that I asked the AI assistant through chat to give me content. And the way I would ask Google is exactly what you said, it can actually you can refine your asks much quicker and much better. And so like a good example is I was comparing contrast, and just like really general questions. And so I said, Hey, like, give me some marketing tactics that I can use for a small business of a certain size that doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any marketing budget and a list of that, like some pretty generic stuff, like but if you search on Google, you\u0026rsquo;re gonna pretty generic stuff. And one of them was influencer marketing. And then I said, okay, like, talk to me about the do\u0026rsquo;s and don\u0026rsquo;ts of influencer marketing. And I kept refining to the point that I asked the AI, could you write me an outreach email? So I can reach out to these influencers and convince them to actually work with me? And what can I like, and it\u0026rsquo;s that refinement, that is like much better than the Google search experience. Ben Tossell 7:47\nThe work is not doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like it\u0026rsquo;s on you. Whereas if you\u0026rsquo;re using Google, the work is on you to go find the stuff, collate it, put together, refine it, and do all of that stuff. And people are lazy, people don\u0026rsquo;t want to do the work around it. And the same, I think, when you\u0026rsquo;re in that flow of I\u0026rsquo;m currently writing, and then it\u0026rsquo;s going back and forth, and it the AI is writing for you. And you\u0026rsquo;re refining you\u0026rsquo;re tweaking, I\u0026rsquo;ll actually actually want to reach out to the salespeople, like what would be a good opener for these kinds of people in this kind of background. And this kind of whatever I think just that whole user interface of it is, is a massive, massive improvement on what we\u0026rsquo;ve currently seen. Kieran Flanagan 8:27\nIt does not lend itself to Google\u0026rsquo;s current monetization model. Like at the moment, there\u0026rsquo;s this kind of awkward relationship between Google and publishers, like we give you your content, and you give us some traffic back. Whereas open AI, it\u0026rsquo;s somewhat changed that relationship completely. And I don\u0026rsquo;t know how this is going to work long term, which is we give you our content, you learn from that give us the answers. But you don\u0026rsquo;t you don\u0026rsquo;t really give us anything in return. Because I\u0026rsquo;m not going to get traffic of that I get no really brand visibility of that. One of the things I started doing whenever I asked her the question, I would ask it to cite its resources that backed up its claims, so I could see like the articles maybe it was pulling from but do you just think that\u0026rsquo;s like technology is way ahead of copyright laws at the moment? Because the how do publishers get any value from that long term? Like what what\u0026rsquo;s the, if this kind of experience becomes the search experience of choice, it\u0026rsquo;s still somewhat reliant on publishers publishing some of that content. So we can learn from but there\u0026rsquo;s no payback for publishing the same way there is for Google. Ben Tossell 9:23\nYeah, it\u0026rsquo;s a difficult topic, I think, because I can fully imagine the future is an address bar that you type start typing something into, it finishes off the sentence for you. And then it actually just finds the best information for you there summarizes it and gives it to you in that moment, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t send you go to this link, view this blog post by this person and do that thing. And actually, it was called Blue coat, who he did a tweet that was like, This is what I think the future of search will be like is they\u0026rsquo;ll finish it off and all of that stuff. So the problem is, Google\u0026rsquo;s gotten in its own way a bit. Because none of us like Google search, like none of us actually like the experience of what we have to do need to go and find the thing. And even Google knows that to an extent, and it can\u0026rsquo;t completely change its Google search the way it works, because that\u0026rsquo;s their monetization model. That\u0026rsquo;s where they get all their ad revenue from so you search and you search something, you want the link, you want the link, what is the top female investor, you want that the link to go to that person\u0026rsquo;s Wikipedia or their, their personal site, you don\u0026rsquo;t want to go? Okay, here\u0026rsquo;s a list of results that have lists of female investors. So I now going into each of those and trying to do the research myself, I think it\u0026rsquo;s going to be interesting, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know. And hopefully, it actually means that writing for writing sake to get traffic kind of goes away. And it changes to be just useful information. And Google does this a bit with like, you can see the listicles that they they sort of promoted at the top of the top of the search result. Now if you search for something, there\u0026rsquo;s a good example, I can\u0026rsquo;t remember how to build an app, or whatever, it\u0026rsquo;s something like that. There\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;ll show you it like sort of a semi extended abstract of a blog post, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to go into the blog post to do that, it\u0026rsquo;ll sort of give you a list there, which is kind of going this direction, but it is hoping that you\u0026rsquo;re then gonna go and view that link. And people might still if the link is, like you said with the source, it says this information was pulled from this link and this link, you can then go and do more of that research. Kieran Flanagan 11:25\nBut the reason someone writes that article that these models can learn from our use is because there\u0026rsquo;s a pay, they paid back, I just wonder, like, why would I even bother? And then if I don\u0026rsquo;t bother, how do they work long term, they\u0026rsquo;re still somewhat relying on the publishers. But Google\u0026rsquo;s model has paid back for the publishers, but there\u0026rsquo;s no payback for the publishers, then why even do it? And I agree, I think part of the problem is, there\u0026rsquo;s gonna be better monetization models for this tool. And that\u0026rsquo;s not ads, but ads is probably the most profitable monetization model. So I don\u0026rsquo;t know how Google navigates that. One of the other ones I know, I\u0026rsquo;m kind of being a really bad host, because I asked for things that you thought were most impactful. But one, I want to kind of just get to real fast, because I saw you tweeting about this as well. The one that really started to blow my mind was coding. People just write in, like Paki does not born, asked me to write a whole app that they could just like, take the code and use, like, was that incredible for you? Or did you find that like, pretty unbelievable? Or is this a known thing that it can code that easily through AI? Ben Tossell 12:23\nYeah, well, I don\u0026rsquo;t code. So something like this is interesting for me, because I never have been able to learn how to code. So I\u0026rsquo;m like, where do I start? Alright, where do I put that piece of code? Or what is what is this file? Where do I put this, like, what\u0026rsquo;s my terminal? Those things you could ask in line to ChatGPT as you\u0026rsquo;re learning to code. So I think that is really incredible. But I did use Codex , which is another model from OpenAI , which just write in plain English, it will generate code for you. So you say I want a web page with a form in that form, I want an input field. And then I want a button that says submits the input field needs to like take an email address. And then when this happens, when they click the button, this thing pops up. Like you can do that by writing in plain English, it\u0026rsquo;ll generate the code and actually generate the app in front of you, which I\u0026rsquo;ve already already saw that. So I was assuming that that kind of stuff is going to come back up and resurface in another model, which it now has. And there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of examples of people using code this way. So yeah, Pachi\u0026rsquo;s example was, I want to build a web app. I think there\u0026rsquo;s an AI web app on an AI summary app. So then ChatGPT generated the code, and then a few bits of code that you did, you click Copy, and then you went to wrap it, which is like a in browser coding environment. You can literally just copy, paste, submit, Oh, I\u0026rsquo;m getting this bug. You put that in the conversation saying, I\u0026rsquo;m getting this bug, what do I need to do? And then it says, Oh, you need to change this to this. And then if you\u0026rsquo;re saying, I actually, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to, like, have cookies or something on the site, if you didn\u0026rsquo;t want to do something, you could say that and it would say, okay, take this line out of the code. So your new code should look like this. Like it\u0026rsquo;s just constantly iterating on things. I\u0026rsquo;m actually done it and have hired someone to try and do a really good tutorial of this, which is, can you build a website\u0026rsquo;s purely using ChatGPT and Replit not knowing any code and literally typing an English copying and pasting can you build an app and before I got that tutorial back Pachi did that and I saw all these people. So the answer is yes. Kieran Flanagan 14:33\nBecause what it means is, the biggest barrier for most people to come in builders, like there\u0026rsquo;s probably like, you don\u0026rsquo;t code. I actually did computer science at university. That\u0026rsquo;s what I did. And I coded really badly and then give up because it was too hard. And so I don\u0026rsquo;t code either. But I would love to have be able to build things. But the biggest barrier to doing that, for a lot of people is like the ability to actually code or learn the language. And so it feels like a lot of what AI is going to help do is unlock people\u0026rsquo;s Korea. activity, because it\u0026rsquo;s like the the barrier from going from creative idea to actual final product is not going to be the tool in anymore. And I think that part is going to be pretty unbelievable in terms of how we see like the evolution of all this, like what happens when we unlock all these kinds of creative ideas that people have, but have never been able to put into practice because they haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to learn to learn or have been able to learn the software, Ben Tossell 15:25\nI think is pretty important actually. Like, I founded a company called Makerpad . And that\u0026rsquo;s what I sold to Zapier , and that is still running now. And that was no code education. It\u0026rsquo;s basically because I couldn\u0026rsquo;t code I figured out that you could use tools like web flow, and Zapier and Airtable , stitch them together and build a membership site, for example. Now, the reason I did that is because I tried to code it didn\u0026rsquo;t ever code I tried to code always hit the barrier of I just can\u0026rsquo;t, my brain is not like I can\u0026rsquo;t understand this. Secondly, write all this stuff. And then wait ages and see something come up and be like, right, I gotta go back to it. Is it that function is it that line, I can see a website, I can see where a button is, I can see how to round the corner, I can see how to like move it around. And it should be point and click. So that\u0026rsquo;s what no code brought to us. And it really became a big, big thing of the last few years. And then now there\u0026rsquo;s this. So I think there\u0026rsquo;s like an evolution of coding, no coding, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what the word is now. It\u0026rsquo;s just you write it and then it can be generated for you. And I think that that is huge. Kieran Flanagan 16:29\nYeah, text to code. Ben Tossell 16:31\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s also about like, the learning the education piece of that. And education as a whole really is, you can reverse engineer an app, or like you can write these things and try and figure it out. And you could basically just put those screenshots into a tutorial and say, like, enter this into ChatGPT and then that will generate this code, then copy that to this, it\u0026rsquo;s just, you can do so much with this, I just think it\u0026rsquo;s going to be really, really powerful. And yeah, like you said, unlocking everyone\u0026rsquo;s ability to do that is just a whole new, whole new wave of entrepreneurs being able to build stuff. And really the one, one thing I added, I\u0026rsquo;ve got little like Ben\u0026rsquo;s thesis notes, I can fully imagine a future where all internal tools are built by yourself for yourself . So if I wanted a Chrome extension, that made sure, certain emails from certain people never gotten to my inbox or whatever, it\u0026rsquo;s just something something silly like that, I can literally type that and say, Hey, I\u0026rsquo;d like a Chrome extension that does this, tell me how to install it, tell me how to unpack it and tell me how to run it on my machine locally. Instead of me going and trying 1030 different tools and paying $10 a month for each and forgetting to cancel them and all of that sort of fast that you have to get to, in the time that it would take me to sign up for one tool, I could probably build that myself. Obviously, at the moment, there\u0026rsquo;s still code involved, you have to copy it and deploy it and all of that stuff. But I can fully see a future where you are just typing these things, the codes being created for you. And you can install that internal tool, it\u0026rsquo;s literally an audience of one built by yourself for the exact use case that you have Kieran Flanagan 18:12\nyour build your own tech stack. What are the other things that is kind of mind blowing? If we think about where we\u0026rsquo;ve gone, like, okay, maybe a replacement for starch allows everyone to be a builder, because it really reduces the complexity of the code to just being able to like think of the thing, right, the thing, get the code. The other one I don\u0026rsquo;t know if you\u0026rsquo;ve seen it, you probably have seen it, Ben, because I know you you have that you have your newsletter, I find a lot of my stuff actually in your newsletter. But one of the products that is really mind blowing, is Adept AI , um, which is like an AI overlay on to all software. And so I can just interact, I never had to be have to use the software, again, like it\u0026rsquo;s removing the barrier of having to learn to do any of this stuff. And now all you need is the idea to do that stuff. But you don\u0026rsquo;t have you seen that? Like it\u0026rsquo;s a Chrome extension that sets on products, and you can just type in what you want the product to do. And we\u0026rsquo;ll do our thing. Ben Tossell 18:58\nYeah, exactly. And I mean, that is one really big, obvious example of it, which is, hey, go find all these people go and enrich them with clear bit and then go and send them a mass like email with whatever you think is the best email to get to those people to convince them of insert topic. Like that could happen with something like this. But even that is another thing to have on a site. You could just sit there with ChatGPT in the future and just type it and not even be anywhere else. Like these tools are thing I get about these tools it needs to be it needs to be in front of you needs to be where you are at the time. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t. It can\u0026rsquo;t be Oh, and you got to open that app on my menu bar or things like that needs to be really like in your flow to be able to be really effective and adapt I think is a really really like I\u0026rsquo;m waiting to get off that waitlist. I\u0026rsquo;m sure like everyone else signed up a few times now somewhere we don\u0026rsquo;t even further down. But yeah, yeah, I really want to give it a go because that that kind of thing. I just think it just seems obvious. It seems like if you can tell me exactly what What to do and how to do it. Just one, I just want to say, Okay, do it then like, don\u0026rsquo;t do it if you can do all these things, and maybe that\u0026rsquo;s something that GPT-4 might unlock for us. We\u0026rsquo;ll have to wait, I suppose. Kipp Bodnar 20:10\nYeah, you been following up to the Adept conversation? What I what I would have to jump in with actually was, how do you think things like the GPT-3 chat and everything are going to impact design? And like, I was thinking a lot about like website design, you\u0026rsquo;re talking about, hey, somebody can just come and have this chat interface, like on a website, it\u0026rsquo;s like, how much of a website do you actually need? Then, if I could just ask this thing? How much this thing costs? And does it work for companies like me? All of these things? Like how does it fundamentally change in your mind, like what a website may look like or be in the future? Ben Tossell 20:46\nYeah, that\u0026rsquo;s a good question. Because it\u0026rsquo;s a first thought you\u0026rsquo;re going to just say, like, the actual design of the website, because I saw someone using Midjourney to like, generate these landing page examples. And they were all looked like all of the landing pages at the moment. But yeah, I mean, you could literally see that, like, there\u0026rsquo;s no need for scrolling. It\u0026rsquo;s just like an input field, like a search box on every site. It has like a tagline that says, we do this speak. Like, it could genuinely be like that. And I don\u0026rsquo;t know, what extent and where we are, and when that may happen, if it will happen. But it does feel like a pretty big thing to be considering. And like I was saying is, you might not even need to go on a website to find out the tool like you could just build a tool yourself by like conversing with ChatGPT and say, I want a tool that does this, can you get the code and install it on my machine for me and just set it up, you might not need to go to the sites to say, oh, I want to sign up for Buffer or whatever these these tools are. Kipp Bodnar 21:42\nSo I think I think there are a couple of things interesting in there that I would unpack, which is like the first of all, you\u0026rsquo;re talking about, like consolidating the whole buying experience, right? Where you have all these stages, where it\u0026rsquo;s like, oh, I go do some research, then I figure out what I\u0026rsquo;m going to buy. And then I go and set it up. You\u0026rsquo;re like, oh, maybe maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a day where AI will do all of that for you. And at that point, the second weird thing is that AI becomes the purchasing decision maker, not the human, right, because you\u0026rsquo;re like, oh, I need to solve this problem. And either AI comes back and says you should do this, or you should do these, one of these three are some kind of subset of things. Do you think we\u0026rsquo;re ever gonna get to a point like that? Ben Tossell 22:18\nI\u0026rsquo;d love to not have to book a call or book a demo to find an enterprise pricing plan. So well, yeah, like that sort of stuff. Feels just it should be searchable. I think. I mean, I think we will get to that, to be honest. But I can\u0026rsquo;t even imagine the rest of the world and all the knock on effects of Yeah, internet experience. And that\u0026rsquo;s, that\u0026rsquo;s what I struggle with to say yet, like, websites will be like this. Because then I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine all the other ones are now redundant. Is that really what we\u0026rsquo;re doing all day upgrade really all due to that Kieran Flanagan 22:49\nit can\u0026rsquo;t recommend something that like, at the moment anyway, and I don\u0026rsquo;t see how it can change and I get it See, I say what\u0026rsquo;s the best I was trying to ask it? What\u0026rsquo;s the best scheduling tool on it\u0026rsquo;s like a I can\u0026rsquo;t, I\u0026rsquo;m an AI tool, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to recommend the best one. But here are some ones. And I will still give me like five. And then I asked like, how did you get up, come up with these five? And I couldn\u0026rsquo;t really figure out because it won\u0026rsquo;t, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have access to like user reviews at the moment. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t it\u0026rsquo;s not it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have access, like reviews or recommendations, because in a world that where it starts to recommend the only one like if you only have one, then that\u0026rsquo;s a I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s a great result for anyone. Kipp Bodnar 23:23\nNo, let me try something. Let me try something on both of you and see if you buy it or you don\u0026rsquo;t buy it, which is like today, the content and information we put out as companies is primarily for humans, secondarily for machines. Right, so cool. We build this great website for our customers, then we make sure it\u0026rsquo;s indexable by Google and Google can crawl it people can it can be discovered by by the current kind of technical infrastructure. Do you think in the future, there\u0026rsquo;s a chance that we could flop that right where the you know, the majority of content we create is machine first customer second, where you\u0026rsquo;ve been? You were kind of getting at that where it\u0026rsquo;s like, oh, it\u0026rsquo;s going to incentivize people to have a lot more transparency and public information to feed feed AI feed the models? Or do you think that is this like crazy talk and we\u0026rsquo;re still going to be human first versus machine first? And like kind of the content we\u0026rsquo;re creating? Ben Tossell 24:12\nWell, we\u0026rsquo;ll always be human first. I think we will always have that on our side. Oh, yeah. The thing about the AI stuff is you\u0026rsquo;re saying about like a product being recommended, and it being the only product but that will be probably the only product that would work for you. It will start learning what you like and yeah, you\u0026rsquo;re willing to spend and how you like to spend your days if your meetings have fallen knew you had need like new podcast equipment or stuff like that. I think it would learn from a podcast similar to what you run. They seem to talk about the shore mic or the blue mic or whatever it is like I could see a world where that is happening. And I think this is true for all AI where everyone\u0026rsquo;s scared that AI will take over everything. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be like a sandwich and there\u0026rsquo;s an article, I need to remember the name of it. That was really good. I put it on the email. thing yesterday. And it\u0026rsquo;s like, we\u0026rsquo;re all sorts of going to become directors where we start the input where the creative thoughts, and then AI does all the work, finds the reviews, writes the blog posts, whatever it is. And then we go in and refine the bits at the end and say, Oh, actually, I don\u0026rsquo;t really want to spend 50 pounds on that I\u0026rsquo;d rather spend 200 pounds on that, oh, no, I need it today. Not tomorrow, like anything like that, I assume there\u0026rsquo;s always going to be a touch point of human AI human. And that will probably be the interface. Well, that\u0026rsquo;s what I can imagine is the interface of way of how we work with us. And the AI will learn things and recommend things and all of that I\u0026rsquo;m sure that. Kipp Bodnar 25:38\nThe thing I\u0026rsquo;m most scared of, for everybody watching is that AI slows down human human change. Like if you just keep getting fed things you like, then you don\u0026rsquo;t know like how to evolve and change as much like, I don\u0026rsquo;t want humans to get too comfortable or too set in their ways of like, this is Oh, I like these things that I just get more and more of the stuff we\u0026rsquo;d like. Because that seems like a terrible existence for like, society. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. Like, I\u0026rsquo;m way more scared of that then AI taking over the world. Kieran Flanagan 26:07\nWell, that\u0026rsquo;s that\u0026rsquo;s actually why I said I don\u0026rsquo;t think it being able to recommend you the one thing is a good thing. It has nothing to skip. I think discovery for humans is an important aspect of like, learning, trying new things. It\u0026rsquo;s a really important thing for having an I think a vibrant business ecosystem where you can discover new products and that you never even knew you wanted or you products that you didn\u0026rsquo;t know existed. I guess like, it feels like this is monumental. I was trying to like, where is it? Kipp Bodnar 26:39\nLike, you\u0026rsquo;re kind of like, fuck what the hell is happening here? Kieran Flanagan 26:41\nI was trying to I was trying to figure out, is it the iPhone? Or is it the internet? Or maybe those two things are somewhat like, you know, maybe the I think the internet is like, just more it has been more impactful than the iPhone. But the iPhone wouldn\u0026rsquo;t happen, obviously, with the internet, but like, This feels like the actual, like, changing of ways we interact with the internet. Kipp Bodnar 27:03\nMaybe Web 3 isn\u0026rsquo;t Web 3, it\u0026rsquo;s AI. Kieran Flanagan 27:05\nThis is what Web 3 wanted to be. Yeah, it is dude, like the you know, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to get into an AI versus Web 3. But the one thing I will say is like, in terms of finding new use case, every single person on Twitter is seems to be using OpenAI . Kipp Bodnar 27:26\nLiterally everyone is on a wait list for some tool. Kieran Flanagan 27:29\nIt is currently down, because I\u0026rsquo;m trying to write a script in a Stephen King novel style to freak my friends out, and it\u0026rsquo;s down, I haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to do that. But what do you think, Ben? Where do you kind of rank this in terms of the evolution of you know, tech and humans where you put it and like, maybe round out with some of your the things that you think are going to happen in the next six months, twelve months that are going to be mind blowing for people? Ben Tossell 27:53\nYeah, well, I think first, I think we will not we can always rely on humans to have an opinion. I love that it\u0026rsquo;s us all being the same and having the same products. We couldn\u0026rsquo;t even force that on everyone. If we want to do with AI, I don\u0026rsquo;t think we\u0026rsquo;ll get there because people just wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have it. And I\u0026rsquo;m sure that AI will be built and trained. With that in mind, like it knows humans and what we do and what we don\u0026rsquo;t do. It feels much. Yeah, it definitely feels like a massive technology shift like Cloud was, or the internet like it does feel like that it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to be writing about it and showing off other people\u0026rsquo;s stuff without thinking that and just thinking this has to be what everything is like every business, there is a like an add on, or some injection of AI that actually could make this better, make the people more productive or make something happen. I think I just I can\u0026rsquo;t even predict if I\u0026rsquo;d be working on it, but I think the six, the six to twelve month thing is like, we\u0026rsquo;re going to see a bunch of the exact same tool built over and over again. I had this I had one idea for a storybook tool that would train on my nephew\u0026rsquo;s face and would put him into a story with like dinosaurs. For the next day, I had a conversation with someone who had the exact same idea. And then the next two days or so full products that were exactly that. Kipp Bodnar 29:18\nWell first of all, it gets back to our point from a previous of security that like going to market and distribution for the AI technologies is going to be what causes them to win because the back end differentiation currently today is low. And the time to build is low. It\u0026rsquo;s so it distribution go to market knowledge is really high. And I think Ben just given your reaction and like how taken aback you are and we all are, I think it\u0026rsquo;s safe to say that AI as we\u0026rsquo;re going to see it is at least going to be on par with the mobile operating system in the web browser in terms of like level of impact on day to day user and in human behavior. It maybe it\u0026rsquo;s bigger than that. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s the internet. I don\u0026rsquo;t know, but it seems like it\u0026rsquo;s at least On par with, you know, the iPhone OS, Android and like, you know, Chrome, Safari, all those things? Ben Tossell 30:07\nYeah, I think so. And I think in the age of like, which image is actually real, which blog post is human generated? I think that people are going to trust people over brands like people aren\u0026rsquo;t going to go to a brand who might have generated AI content, but they might trust a person, if they\u0026rsquo;re writing an email or something to say, this is over this. You\u0026rsquo;re, you\u0026rsquo;re building that trust with the person. I think, if a Google or any of these other big companies come up with blog posts that seem like, Huh, what are they? What are they up to over there? Is that AI generated? I think there\u0026rsquo;s going to be a lot of a lot of that happening. But I mean, I think AI is just a tool in everyone\u0026rsquo;s tool belt that they should be excited about. It\u0026rsquo;s like having Photoshop for designer, you don\u0026rsquo;t know what images are photoshopped, you can tell some of them. But it\u0026rsquo;s going to be a bit like that. And I think humans are always going to be in the loop. And it\u0026rsquo;s going to be a human sandwich, I suppose in that in that sense of using AI? Kipp Bodnar 31:01\nYeah, well, like I saw, I saw the kind of close out I saw, like the stupidest article yesterday, which is like how Amazon has failed with Alexa. And I was like, What are you talking about? They have created the world\u0026rsquo;s best network of AI access points. Like you can say, Alexa is not good enough. But are we gonna be surprised if they just don\u0026rsquo;t swap that over to open AI or whatever the best back end is, and then they just have the perfect access point for, you know, kind of verbal AI that exists that it just I feel like we\u0026rsquo;re in this transition phase. And we\u0026rsquo;re all seeing the world for what it was not the world for what it will be. Ben Tossell 31:41\nYeah, that\u0026rsquo;s just humans in general, and rightly so it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to see what was passed. Like a new technology comes out everyone fights it and thinks that\u0026rsquo;s just crazy. Like, we\u0026rsquo;re not gonna be having robots in our house cleaning our female clothes and ironing bedsheets. But I hope so because I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do. Kieran Flanagan 31:57\nThe best thing about I do love how this stuff brings out human creativity, like the some of the stuff that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen people use it for, I just want to end with my favorite, which is, it seems like really obscure but this guy did. He asked it to write a script about someone arguing about the future of AI but who was secretly in love with this pumpkins, and couldn\u0026rsquo;t go I could have stopped going on tangents about how much he actually loved. Lovecraft was just amazing that the guy\u0026rsquo;s like, oh, yeah, the future it\u0026rsquo;s going to do this and then it goes, but you want to see it this time and my pumpkins. I just anyways, okay, going back to Yeah, I like, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, like it just it does. I do coming back to like the optimism the optimistic side of this is like it just unlocking people\u0026rsquo;s creativity. Like there\u0026rsquo;s so much creativity people and, and tooling is the problem. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s going to be really interesting to see is like, how much cool stuff comes from people now that they, they can actually, you know, get to code get to tax all these things much quicker. Kipp Bodnar 32:54\nI think I think ideas and art and everything are gonna get better, not worse. Ben Tossell 32:57\nAnd we can all sit around on podcasts all day while the AI does the work. Yeah, so that\u0026rsquo;s good, right? Kipp Bodnar 33:03\nSounds awesome. This has been awesome. Ben, thank you so much for your time, and we\u0026rsquo;ll see everybody real soon on Marketing Against the Grain .

He is the no code guide. But more recently, he\u0026rsquo;s become almost the AI guy. He\u0026rsquo;s got this incredible newsletter called Ben\u0026rsquo;s Bites , where he does all the work for you and kind of just looks at the most interesting AI stories. What are interesting use cases of AI, and he breaks it down for you. So I\u0026rsquo;ve been really enjoying his newsletter and just wants to catch up with that. What\u0026rsquo;s keeping him curious, and why he\u0026rsquo;s really excited about AI. And so welcome to the show, Ben. Ben Tossell 00:35\nYeah, excited to chat about stuff and all the crazy magic. That\u0026rsquo;s the swarming internet these days. Greg Isenberg 00:54\nYeah, so before we get into the AI, could you talk a little bit about what got you excited about no code and how you\u0026rsquo;re feeling about no code right now? Ben Tossell 01:05\nYeah, so no code came from, like, a necessity. For me, I can\u0026rsquo;t code. I\u0026rsquo;ve never been able to code. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried, I have tried. And if people say that you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to do it, everyone should learn. I don\u0026rsquo;t think anyone should learn or every I don\u0026rsquo;t think everyone should do. And so that\u0026rsquo;s gonna piss people off. And I was working at Product Hunt at the time. So I was like, a victim of my surroundings. There\u0026rsquo;s all these people launching all these cool things every single day. And I was like, I want to build something, I want to do something as well. I want to like put something together that I\u0026rsquo;ve built. And I couldn\u0026rsquo;t code. So I sort of looked to what can I use off the shelf. And it was things like Zapier and Typeform , and Bubble and Webflow . So I can put these things together and then make it look like I coded it, and it\u0026rsquo;s a real thing. So that\u0026rsquo;s, that\u0026rsquo;s what I started doing. And I started doing that a lot and started pushing, pushing these like tool stacks together, and seeing how far I could push them. So things were like Airbnb without code and stuff like that. So I\u0026rsquo;d really go to, to the extremes to show that these things are possible without needing to code. And also it then became a really quick to do it, you\u0026rsquo;d have to learn code for nine months. And you\u0026rsquo;d have to like, do all of that stuff. You could build something in a weekend and then test it out on the Monday and see if people liked it or hated it. So started doing that, like a ton. And people were just following me. And they were just always asking, how are you doing that? How you doing that? How you doing that. And I thought, I\u0026rsquo;ll just build stuff. And then just remember to record my screen. And that\u0026rsquo;ll be a business I like sell access to my videos. So that\u0026rsquo;s essentially what Makerpad was, it was a tutorial platform and educational platform, ton of tutorials on how to build stuff with no code to how you can put these things together and build an Airbnb or build a membership business or build an Instagram clone on mobile and all these sort of different things that people don\u0026rsquo;t know how to build if they can\u0026rsquo;t code. So yeah, that was started as a side project in January 2019. I took about 350k of funding from calmfund and other angels in September, October 2019. And then we were acquired by Zapier in March 2021. So it was quite quite a quick process. But yeah, it was it was awesome. It\u0026rsquo;s sort of like before the no code trend kicked off. And then we sort of rode that wave as it kicked off. And I think it\u0026rsquo;s even as prominent today as it was then I just think even with all this AI stuff, I think they\u0026rsquo;re all actually connected. And it\u0026rsquo;s all to do with democratization of software development, like doing more with software, without needing to be technical, or needing to know, all these really specific things in order to do X with software. Greg Isenberg 04:02\nOkay, what\u0026rsquo;s really interesting about your story is you really just like followed your curiosity. You know, I felt like it came from a place of purity. It\u0026rsquo;s like, people should be able to do this, or hey, I really want to do this and other people might be willing to pay or, or just be interested in it. But what did you ever think the business of no code and teaching and community could be really big? Or were you just like, I\u0026rsquo;m just going to put some stuff out there. And, you know, hopefully it works out. Ben Tossell 04:31\nI think my whole life has been put stuff out there and see what works. I always wanted to be an entrepreneur, I always thought I\u0026rsquo;d be like some hotshot CEO one day, and that has never happened still, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be that actually it ends up but I just was never happy with this is how it is. So learn to code or don\u0026rsquo;t that can\u0026rsquo;t be the future of how people build stuff on the internet. Like if it makes sense to me like you have to learn to code. Well, what if I really struggled to learn to code like what if I can\u0026rsquo;t I don\u0026rsquo;t work with numbers and functions and I don\u0026rsquo;t work like my brain doesn\u0026rsquo;t work that way. I want to have quicker feedback loops. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be a software engineer. I just want to make stuff. And then yeah, I tried. I think I launched like 50 things before Makerpad had happened and Makerpad had happened because people didn\u0026rsquo;t pay for all my other things. They would see the things I built. I\u0026rsquo;d say, Yeah, cool. I\u0026rsquo;m not buying that. But how did you do it? And I was like, sort of that those who can\u0026rsquo;t do teach type scenario where I was like, Well, I can just show you and I, I\u0026rsquo;d seen gorails is the website. It\u0026rsquo;s like a screencasting business. It was called at the time, I saw that on indie hackers. And I was like, Well, this guy makes like, 15 grand a month, just recording his screen and building stuff that is interesting to him. Like, that seems cool. That\u0026rsquo;s a one person business. It seems like a very simple, straightforward thing to do. I bet I could do something like that. I can\u0026rsquo;t pretend that I like thought it all up and then mediate reality just happened as when? Greg Isenberg 05:59\nYeah, there wasn\u0026rsquo;t like a grand plan, you kind of just like, went with it. Now you\u0026rsquo;re spending a lot of time thinking about the world of AI. And I think a lot of people are interested in AI, and they\u0026rsquo;re seeing stuff happen. But it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s confusing, I think, to a lot of people just to understand, like the lay of the land. Could you explain basically what AI is? Like, let\u0026rsquo;s start from scratch. What is AI? Why should people care about it? Ben Tossell 06:27\nYeah, well, I\u0026rsquo;m probably gonna butcher a bunch of things in this episode about AI. And I\u0026rsquo;m sure people will be very vocal on the internet. Well, I do. But to me, I think AI is like, a computer doing something for you. Without with almost like a thinking element. You can go into the technicals of neural networks and all things like that. But to me on a very basic level, it\u0026rsquo;s just like, it does magic stuff. And I know that\u0026rsquo;s really fluffy. But I think when you when you use some of these things, and you see the use cases of them, you understand like, oh, yeah, why why isn\u0026rsquo;t it that? And I suppose that\u0026rsquo;s similar to the no code vein where if you\u0026rsquo;re, if you can\u0026rsquo;t figure out a formula in Excel, and you\u0026rsquo;re like, I just want to have this divided by this, then times by that, why can\u0026rsquo;t you write it like that, and then have the computer that does has all this power in it to actually figure out what you mean by those things, put it together, write the right formula, create it in a code that a computer understands, and then pulls out the information that you\u0026rsquo;re actually looking for that side of things, people might understand a bit more worse, like you translating what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to think of, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know the answer to and given us computer to solve that problem for me. There\u0026rsquo;s loads of different use cases. And I\u0026rsquo;m sure we\u0026rsquo;ll get into a bunch of them today, like generative AI, art and things like that. So yeah, there\u0026rsquo;s, there\u0026rsquo;s loads of different ways to look at that. I think AI is actually more of a bolt on, it\u0026rsquo;s like a feature for most companies, rather than AI is the thing. AI is almost like Google Search to people. So how is Google, like, got all these results, and put them all together and put them in a in a list for me, a computer can do so many more things than we can understand. And AI is just that on steroids, like to a complete new level. So we can finish a story for you, we could write an email for you, you can give it some context. And it\u0026rsquo;s what people calling prompt engineering, you sort of write a prompt, so you write something, write me an email that I\u0026rsquo;m asking, I want to ask for a raise for my boss. And then it will just create that from all of this information that\u0026rsquo;s consumed from the internet. And then they\u0026rsquo;ll put that together in an email that is readable. It makes sense. It might not make sense for your use case, because you didn\u0026rsquo;t give it any context. But it can do those sorts of tasks, which look quite fun, I think on the on the outside. And people are really seeing a lot of those kinds of demos and things now over the last few months. I really like they\u0026rsquo;re going they\u0026rsquo;re going crazy. Greg Isenberg 09:10\nWhat are what are some of the categories of AI like you talk about generative art, you know, you talk about writing, give a sense to people, you know, what are the different areas that you think AI and prompt based AI? You know, they said Software is eating the world like AI is eating the world? What are the different categories? Ben Tossell 09:32\nYeah, AI is probably eaten software. They\u0026rsquo;re all the same categories as startups and technology in general is just AI enabled in front of them. So audio, for example. Everyone knows, like we are recording a podcast now on a platform. And we are doing some stuff. They\u0026rsquo;re recording things locally. They\u0026rsquo;re doing a bunch of things to make it easy for us to record this and then you can put it out as a podcast on poker As players now where AI and audio sort of intersect, there\u0026rsquo;s Okay, well, you can have Joe Rogan interviewing Steve Jobs where everyone knows that that interview did not happen. But you can train AI on a voice, it could understand how someone speaks, what their mannerisms are, what kind of topics they talk about. And then they can put those things together. Almost, like almost perfectly at the moment with, like listening to a normal podcast like, like, you and I are speaking here. Yeah, I mean, voice cloning, I think just in general, you can you speak into your own computer 20 times, and then it\u0026rsquo;ll come back with you write a sentence, you type one in or you have an AI generate a sentence for you. And then that would speak to you in your voice. And it\u0026rsquo;s pretty good on the first pass, like you can go deeper and train it better and better. But the technology there now is just, it\u0026rsquo;s really, really crazy of how, how advanced it is. And images is obviously a huge one that everyone\u0026rsquo;s probably seen some, some talk about AI art, whether it\u0026rsquo;s art, not art, and all of that stuff. As because, yeah, pictures, speak 1000 words. And that image has never been created before. Like ever, that image is not in its form has not ever been made before. But a computer completely generated that from understanding the references within that photo. So if it\u0026rsquo;s a horse, on the moon, doing whatever, like it understands what a horse is, understands what the moon is, and it like can put those together and generate an image that has never been made before. And those kinds of things are almost unbelievable as in. Why don\u0026rsquo;t we always say unbelievable, but that is almost unbelievable that that kind of thing just can happen. Because for someone like me who cannot draw a ball, it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s like, well, I can make these images that are just so much better than I could ever, ever dream of like doing. And then there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of use cases after that, which is product imagery, like you see all these DTC brands with extra ink in colored background, like you\u0026rsquo;re gonna have a ton of those images, you could even have ads being optimized, like AI could be writing the copy, and showing them generating an image and then all of a sudden, it\u0026rsquo;ll swap and change a few things. And you\u0026rsquo;ll see what that CTR was much better. Let\u0026rsquo;s go with this one. And then they just optimize it automatically, you can see that that is definitely going to be happening. I just can\u0026rsquo;t see how AI and like, advertising doesn\u0026rsquo;t come to you set up something, say I\u0026rsquo;m selling subscriptions to my newsletter or anything. And you just sort of give it a prompt and say that it\u0026rsquo;ll generate copy, it\u0026rsquo;ll generate images, it\u0026rsquo;ll run the ads, test the ads, and get you the most bang for your buck, I suppose. Greg Isenberg 13:07\nI want to talk about what are some of the most interesting, like maybe the five most interesting AI companies or projects to watch. And while I give you a few seconds to think about that. I want to talk about one that I downloaded this morning that I think is really cool. It\u0026rsquo;s by Trung Phan , who you probably know, you know, he was a writer for the hustle. He writes these amazing threads on Twitter that get you know, I see I saw it the other day Elon Musk replies to it. So Elon Musk is replying to your threads like something\u0026rsquo;s working. Yeah. It\u0026rsquo;s called bearly.ai . And I believe it works with OpenAI and it\u0026rsquo;s focused on writers. So it\u0026rsquo;s AI problems for writers. So I\u0026rsquo;m pulling it up right now. Let\u0026rsquo;s see what it can do. So, you know, just to give you a sense, you can summarize content, you know, you can put something in and it\u0026rsquo;ll summarize all of that content. There\u0026rsquo;s some, there\u0026rsquo;s a function called polish, clarify and expand on your ideas. So you just put something in there, and it will literally clarify and expand on your ideas. Create an essay outline, like one of the hardest things to do if you\u0026rsquo;re a writer is writing an outline. Here, you have a prompt for that headlines for your blog post. You know, the right headline, the right hook, if you\u0026rsquo;re a writer, is the difference between your blog posts or posts getting seen by 100,000 people or millions. So help here is super awesome. And I started using it this morning. And I was like, wow, this is like, it\u0026rsquo;s not perfect. But it at least helps me like let\u0026rsquo;s say, create an essay outline, I might be like, Wow, I never thought about point number seven, or point number eight, or point number six. And it actually makes me feel like I have a writing partner, it takes something that\u0026rsquo;s really big, like GPT-3, and focuses it on a niche, and just tries to be the best thing for that particular niche. So I\u0026rsquo;m curious what you think of that product? And then I\u0026rsquo;d love for you to talk about your five most interesting AI projects and companies. Ben Tossell 16:25\nYeah, sure, we should talk about, like AI as a partner. Like, we should talk about that afterwards. But bearly.ai is something I use every day, I\u0026rsquo;ve used it before it came out like it was I was one of the early users, I think I might might be one of the top users. And I\u0026rsquo;ve got some requests that should be coming out within bearly.ai soon as well. So the reason I find it so useful is it lives in my workflow. So the difference with some of these AI tools is like an AI writing tool, if you have to go to another place to start writing your thing. But you actually like writing the Google Docs, like that\u0026rsquo;s already a change of a change of scenery for you. And it might already disruptive flow, and you\u0026rsquo;ve got like your templates, you\u0026rsquo;ve got things that you do to write in Google Docs. But then, if you\u0026rsquo;re using something like Jasper or copy.ai , you\u0026rsquo;ve got to go there. And it\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s a point for drop off. Whereas bearly.ai is a Chrome extension. So anytime I\u0026rsquo;m on a page to say I\u0026rsquo;m on a, on an article that I\u0026rsquo;m thinking, this would be good to put in the email today, I can click the icon, click executive summary. And that\u0026rsquo;ll summarize everything in like two sentences for me. So I can use that and say, Okay, well, actually, I\u0026rsquo;d write it in this way. Or, like, there\u0026rsquo;s something in there that\u0026rsquo;s actually helped me understand what this article is about. Lots of these things are very technical. There\u0026rsquo;s all these research papers, I use barely AI for every single one of them just to check that, am I understanding this this concept correctly. So for me, it\u0026rsquo;s been invaluable for my process to like, actually create stuff for the newsletter, too, because it helps me explain it to, to try and dumb it down and try and make it a bit easier for a reader to see what this thing is about. So bearly.ai is my top used AI tool, I think, I think we\u0026rsquo;ve got to give a nod to stable diffusion. They\u0026rsquo;re an open, like open AI has DALL-E. That\u0026rsquo;s a closed system. So you can\u0026rsquo;t you don\u0026rsquo;t know what\u0026rsquo;s going on behind the scenes there. But stable diffusion, open source their model, and they\u0026rsquo;ve done. Like they\u0026rsquo;ve trained on a ton of parameters, they just released stable diffusion 2.0. So it\u0026rsquo;s, like 1.5 was only released six weeks, seven weeks ago, something like that. So it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s moving really quick. And I almost think that being open source is actually helping it grow that quickly. So that\u0026rsquo;s out right now. There\u0026rsquo;s another one called lexica . And some of the some of the images that are coming out of that they\u0026rsquo;ve got a new model dropping any day now. And the photo realism, like they can even do hands like AI art generally is quite bad with like showing an actual five finger hand. But this lexica one is, it\u0026rsquo;s just insane. Like they just had today, there\u0026rsquo;s some polaroid versions of like, like an airline crew. And they just look flawless. There\u0026rsquo;s metaphor search, which is a metaphor systems rather, which is like a new search experience. So instead of going to Google and say, Who is the best female investor, you go to metaphor, and you say, the best female investor is. And then you click enter, and it\u0026rsquo;ll give you like, a top search. And then I\u0026rsquo;ll give you other people and it gives you the link to where that person\u0026rsquo;s information is Wikipedia page or a personal website and things like that. But also, the issue I see with something like metaphor is you\u0026rsquo;ve got to, you\u0026rsquo;ve got to write it differently. You\u0026rsquo;ve got to type in something differently, and they give you help on how to like, write the prompts. But I just think this in general, like I don\u0026rsquo;t think prompt engineering is actually valuable, a valuable thing because I believe all these models and all these tools will actually, like abstract that away anyway. So if I\u0026rsquo;m looking for the best female investor of all time, however, I phrased that sentence, I should have the same result or should have the like, if there is a top female investor, that\u0026rsquo;s what I should see at the top. It shouldn\u0026rsquo;t require me to do the work. So until until these systems get to that point. And like, the prompting sort of gets better. And I mean, with all of these AI systems, none of them are perfect. But I think it\u0026rsquo;d be a mistake to judge what AI can do in the future based on like, oh, well, there\u0026rsquo;s no, the hands have got three fingers. So this is stupid. Like, yeah, okay, fine. But now, almost six weeks later, there\u0026rsquo;s no hands with five fingers, like people are training on these and all these open source things. There\u0026rsquo;s tons of people doing experiments in there and everywhere, research every day, so people will quickly dismiss it because it looks stupid, but it is very early. So Greg Isenberg 21:08\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the Peter Thiel quote, we asked for, like rocket ships or something. And all we got were 140 characters. It\u0026rsquo;s like, we asked for, you know, rocket ships. But all we got were hands with three fingers. Yeah, I mean, with the Google example. I think the question for me is, is AI a completely new paradigm, like, just like how social was a completely new paradigm? You know, it\u0026rsquo;s social. You know, Google was there. You know, Google started in the 90s. They saw Facebook, they saw MySpace, they saw Instagram, they had to buy YouTube. And they knew that search was a big component of have the experience of searching people searching content, but they realistically missed it. And I think that, if it\u0026rsquo;s a completely new paradigm, if AI is a completely new paradigm, it\u0026rsquo;s likely that they will miss a lot of it. If AI ends up becoming just merging with the consumer experience, like it\u0026rsquo;s a new, it\u0026rsquo;s not a new paradigm, but it\u0026rsquo;s a it\u0026rsquo;s a new tool in the toolset. And they can integrate AI into the core experience, ie they don\u0026rsquo;t have to change their core experience, you still go to google.com. And you still like write stuff. But AI is it\u0026rsquo;s like assisted, then I think that they would you know, survive and thrive actually better in that environment. And we\u0026rsquo;re starting to see that second case with Notion like notion just launched. What was it called Notion AI? Ben Tossell 22:47\nYeah, all these writing tools you have like, hey, now you can have AI in your notion docs, until Notion brings everyone out? And then it\u0026rsquo;s like, well, that\u0026rsquo;s redundant. Because I\u0026rsquo;m on your side thinking of is it? Is it a completely new thing like Cloud was? I do think it is. But also, I do also think it\u0026rsquo;s a feature add on, I do think there\u0026rsquo;s a bolt on to many of these experiences, where, if you look at notion, obviously, they\u0026rsquo;re going to add an AI component. But all of these other writing tools are mostly based on GPT-3. So there\u0026rsquo;s no reason why Notion also can\u0026rsquo;t also be based on GPT-3 and provide almost the exact same experience. But if you\u0026rsquo;re building a new document, knowledge, space, whatever it calls itself, with AI from the start, would that look completely different? And could you craft something that there actually makes sense as an AI, first products, but lots of these bigger companies or lots of companies in general will just be able to do most of the capabilities that lots of these like, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to like, downplay them, but these like more throwaway products that AI is enabling. So all these like Avatar AI products, like there\u0026rsquo;s millions of them, because there\u0026rsquo;s no, there\u0026rsquo;s no real difference. It\u0026rsquo;s like they\u0026rsquo;re all very, very similar. Like you ask someone what the difference is, of theirs versus this one is. Mine\u0026rsquo;s got this added style I trained the model on or this one\u0026rsquo;s $20 instead of $30. It\u0026rsquo;s like, yeah, okay, fine. That\u0026rsquo;s like, most I don\u0026rsquo;t know that a profile picture. AI product is a new big company, it\u0026rsquo;s probably something someone does once. I think it\u0026rsquo;s good to show that all these builders like can see something, can make a move on it move quickly, and do something really quite spectacular in such a short amount of time. But some of these things are just redundant if a different company just adds that on. So there\u0026rsquo;s all these writing tools. There\u0026rsquo;s lots of dentists, Google Docs had their version of AI Clippy like, does that then mean that you barely Jaspar , copy.ai , a lot of those sorts of go down in value or just think I don\u0026rsquo;t need these as much obviously, there\u0026rsquo;s, there\u0026rsquo;s big, like fine tuning in their models and stuff. But like when GPT-4 comes out does a lot of that go away as well like all the moat that they\u0026rsquo;ve built up in fine tuning and putting their use cases in and putting their few short examples in, does that almost go away with advances in the actual models themselves that they\u0026rsquo;re based on? So that\u0026rsquo;s, that\u0026rsquo;s a difficult thing to judge as well, because we don\u0026rsquo;t know what it looked like. Greg Isenberg 25:35\nI think the playbook for if you want to create an AI startup and sell it, for a lot of money is this, I think you don\u0026rsquo;t build your own AI models like you leverage, like a GTP-3 or GPT-4, you find a niche that is underserved, that could benefit from prompt based AI, you explore that and create an a great brand and experience around just like how bearly.ai did it focus on writers and you launch that product, then, you know, you do business development deals with the large incumbents, and you try to get integrated as much as possible into their products. And that gives you optionality to potentially sell to them. It also makes them maybe hopefully less less likely to actually just like say, You know what, we don\u0026rsquo;t need you barely AI, we\u0026rsquo;re gonna just build it ourselves. What do you think about that? Ben Tossell 26:48\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s tough at the moment, because so many of these tools have a lot of value, and lots of them are making lots of revenue. But lots of them are copyable. Like, I can just go into open AI playground and have something summarized, it might not be as well summarized as using some of these other tools. But like, I can do some more part of that kind of job. And I just think lots of these tools are you can copy them quite quite easily if you have the know how and any amount of resources. I don\u0026rsquo;t know that. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what we\u0026rsquo;ll see in AI, as the big companies or what the bigger opportunities, I think things like you look at audio labs or like, resemble AI, these sorts of voice cloning technologies that you can see lots of use cases for like, if all podcasts were run on that if people had all this content based off voice cloning. Greg Isenberg 27:48\nBut again, what are those, what are those products for people who don\u0026rsquo;t know what they are? Ben Tossell 27:52\nresemble.ai is one of them. play.ht and audiolabs.io . So there\u0026rsquo;s three, already, there\u0026rsquo;s three, that you can go and like, you repeat a bunch of stuff that they prompt you on the screen, it\u0026rsquo;ll create your voice with AI. And I think I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure that most of it is based on again, open AI whisper that\u0026rsquo;s the model. And then you could have a wall of text, an essay, whatever it is a tweet thread, and it can be read out in your voice. So what I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking of doing is, for the email that I write, just at the top have an auto generated podcast version, that I\u0026rsquo;m not, right, like reciting this every single time. But I\u0026rsquo;ve recorded I\u0026rsquo;ve cloned my voice once that just gets plugged in every time. And then that is what is read out. But again, like three companies come out quickly with that same with the same kinds of features and the same kind of thing. There will be differences in how well they\u0026rsquo;ve trained it the fine tuning the examples they give. And that currently is what a lot of these products moats are I think, if we can call them moats at the moment, because then if a new model comes out, like GPT-4 for example, with writing tools. That\u0026rsquo;s why I think the prompt engineering sort of goes away. It\u0026rsquo;s because the best of the models are, the less you need to be really specific on how you\u0026rsquo;re writing it if you have to give it examples if you have to do all these things, where the efforts on you but really what we\u0026rsquo;re getting to is the effort is not on you, the AI is creating all of that stuff. So I didn\u0026rsquo;t I think it\u0026rsquo;s I think it\u0026rsquo;s interesting to see all these products. Lots of them are a bit samey. But I\u0026rsquo;ve not seen anyone other than like metaphor systems to tackle search so far. There\u0026rsquo;s one I saw today which was storytimes.ai . And I had this I had the same idea the other week, which was I was going to have a 20 photos of mine nephew, he\u0026rsquo;s two and a half. I was gonna get loads of photos of him train a stable diffusion model on his face and turn it into like a Pixar character, then have a story generated with insert, whatever AI to I find, and then create, like a picture book with him like riding dinosaurs and animals and stuff like that. And I had that idea. And I spoke to someone last week, who also said they had that same idea. And then today, I saw someone yesterday, had posted that they built this idea. So it\u0026rsquo;d be really interesting, but I think a lot of these companies need to be quick. They need to raise a lot of money, like you\u0026rsquo;ve seen a few of them, they raise money, and they, they sort of pushing out ahead and they got lots of big marketing campaigns to like be the first mover. I just don\u0026rsquo;t know how it\u0026rsquo;s gonna play out because it is early. Greg Isenberg 30:57\nWhat are the social implications of AI? You know, when you talked about the Steve Jobs and Joe Rogan interview? That\u0026rsquo;s using your words magical, but it\u0026rsquo;s also a bit like makes me feel weird? Yeah, it just makes me feel weird. There\u0026rsquo;s like, probably a bunch of AI ideas that would be in the category of makes me feel weird. For example, like, our loved ones that pass away, and having and having the ability to have conversations with those people. It might feel good, but it also might make us feel weird. So can you talk a little bit more about social implications in AI? Ben Tossell 33:36\nYeah, I mean, I\u0026rsquo;m not very well versed, other than what I\u0026rsquo;ve, what I\u0026rsquo;ve sort of made my own thoughts about which, if there\u0026rsquo;s, I mean, everyone\u0026rsquo;s always my job is to sort of look at all the good things about it and look at everything in a positive light and think, wow, how amazing all this stuff like we get to use all this. But also bad actors have all of that information to and they\u0026rsquo;re probably using it and they\u0026rsquo;ve got access to all these open source models on AI, and who\u0026rsquo;s to say what\u0026rsquo;s right and what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with when they have closed systems? And there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of chatter about all of that. And I have no have no answers for people there. And I just, my thoughts on it is, we\u0026rsquo;re going to be able to tell, actually, I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to contract myself, but I\u0026rsquo;ll carry on anyway, I think we\u0026rsquo;re going to be able to tell there\u0026rsquo;ll be there\u0026rsquo;ll be a system that you can plug in I say, tell me if this video is fake, and it\u0026rsquo;ll say fake or whatever. Like there\u0026rsquo;ll be. There\u0026rsquo;s AI systems. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a few research papers on like detecting what actually is already AI generated. And even Google is not a ranking AI generated blog post and I don\u0026rsquo;t actually know what any content either. I don\u0026rsquo;t really know how they do that. But as there are ways to detect what is generated by AI. And I feel like they\u0026rsquo;d be systems in place that way. But also, it\u0026rsquo;s probably begin going to be as, like few and far between as things are now. So if someone if someone\u0026rsquo;s using Photoshop, and photoshops an image of me doing something that we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be, then like, it\u0026rsquo;s only up to us to say that didn\u0026rsquo;t happen. We didn\u0026rsquo;t do that type thing. But if this image looks flawless and looks exactly like us, that\u0026rsquo;s a difficult thing to then sort of go against, and our AI can do that. Like you look at Twitter today, you don\u0026rsquo;t know what tweet is actually telling the truth. Like, so much of it is hearsay or, or just made up stuff like you just don\u0026rsquo;t know. Greg Isenberg 35:44\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t know who\u0026rsquo;s telling the truth today. In the future, you\u0026rsquo;re not going to know, not only if it\u0026rsquo;s the truth, but is this Ben who\u0026rsquo;s tweeting this? Or is this an AI? Plus no code that like, has tweeted this thing? Ben Tossell 35:59\nYeah. But also today is could this be a ghostwriter that works for ban writing this, like, there\u0026rsquo;s still, it\u0026rsquo;s still all the same stuff that we have to deal with now. But it\u0026rsquo;s just like, it\u0026rsquo;ll be on another level, because things can be generated so quickly. And so to such an extreme and to such accurate accuracy, that seems like it, I heard Steve Jobs saying that to Joe Rogan. And until you know, well, Steve Jobs, never that never happened. And that\u0026rsquo;s, that\u0026rsquo;s where it is. So yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s a tough one. I don\u0026rsquo;t I hope, I\u0026rsquo;m sure there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of people way smarter than me fix trying to figure this stuff out. And I\u0026rsquo;ll be here to link to it. When when it when they come up with that stuff. But yeah, I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I think it\u0026rsquo;s tough. But I\u0026rsquo;m, I\u0026rsquo;m just hoping for the best. But I know. It\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s a problem already. So I think AI just probably adds to it. Greg Isenberg 36:54\nAI and creators, good thing or bad thing. Ben Tossell 36:59\nGreat thing, it\u0026rsquo;s probably the best thing to happen to a creator. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why anyone thinks differently. It\u0026rsquo;s, again, the Photoshop example. Having an AI tool at your disposal, it\u0026rsquo;s like having a Photoshop expert at your disposal. If I\u0026rsquo;m making video or need to have a podcast edited, or I want to make a promo video for something, things like runway, which is a creative video tool, and their marketing videos are insane. And they\u0026rsquo;re all created in runway. Like you can just type scenes that you want to see like walking down an alleyway in Tokyo at nights and it\u0026rsquo;ll like change and raise streetlights. I don\u0026rsquo;t want that building there. Let\u0026rsquo;s put this dog in that in that image there instead. You can just do so much more with so much less. Greg Isenberg 37:49\nYeah, I look at it the same way, like glass half full? How do you how do you use these tools to supercharge you versus use these tools to cut you? You know, I think we\u0026rsquo;re both optimistic in that sense. So I completely agree with you. I read recently that Cathie Wood famous hedge fund manager has said that AI is deflationary. And you know, she says this deflationary, I think because if people are going to be using AI to run their businesses, and they might need less writers, they might need less designers, they might need less engineers. Their profits, you know, could go up and they\u0026rsquo;re also able to pass on cost savings to to their customers. Do you agree that AI is deflationary? Ben Tossell 38:40\nWell, I can see a world where that sort of stuff happens where you need less physical writers because one can maybe do the work of three, if you\u0026rsquo;re producing content like that, obviously, very specific, very contextual writing needs someone from that experience to talk about stuff. So AI can can push you and suggest things and say, Have you thought about this as well? Or like, what about the safety of this and all that sort of stuff, kind of like topics were talking about, but it\u0026rsquo;s not going to replace creative thinking as a human? And I just think that, yeah, if someone can do the job of three people, then why why would businesses hire three when they can hire one? It seems like the same argument to say that, Oh, actually, businesses are now hiring contractors to do their content writing because their CEOs don\u0026rsquo;t want to do it. And I\u0026rsquo;m like, Well, yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s how all of this works, that you hire out for things that you can\u0026rsquo;t do. And you\u0026rsquo;re looking for someone who\u0026rsquo;s the most productive person at that job, to do the best job that they can, so that we can do this thing. And we can charge customers and we can make profits and we can like build a good business. So all of those things still are in line. And I don\u0026rsquo;t think AI will take all of these jobs just You\u0026rsquo;re gonna need someone to like steer the ship and say, Oh, no, this way this way. I think you need reasoning and like the experiences and everything else to like, bring that together. I just Yeah, I can\u0026rsquo;t see it. Greg Isenberg 40:11\nI\u0026rsquo;m gonna ask this question, you\u0026rsquo;re gonna hate it. But I\u0026rsquo;m asking you that anyways. And five years from now, biggest AI prediction so it\u0026rsquo;s, you know we\u0026rsquo;re sitting down November 28 2022 right now. It\u0026rsquo;s November 28 2027. How has the internet changed? And yeah, what\u0026rsquo;s the biggest AI prediction for that? Ben Tossell 40:39\nWhew, I make a very bold prediction. We\u0026rsquo;ll have a company pulling in, like hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. And it\u0026rsquo;ll be like, one or two people actually running that company. That can be a bold prediction. And just I don\u0026rsquo;t know what the internet looks like, hopefully, Twitter is still around because I need it. And I like it. And maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a badge that says, Only posts AI content. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s that. Greg Isenberg 41:1\nI like that. I got a lot. All right, well, then this has been awesome. If people people want to get their feet wet in the world of AI, what do you suggest? Ben Tossell 41:24\nWell, of course, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend checking out Ben\u0026rsquo;s bites. So that\u0026rsquo;s Ben\u0026rsquo;s bite stop beehiiv, B E E H I I V.com. Soon, we\u0026rsquo;ll change to the custom domain. But yeah, thanks, bytes. I just try and dumb everything down and summarize everything daily. So that there\u0026rsquo;s so much there\u0026rsquo;s so much going on, there\u0026rsquo;s research, there\u0026rsquo;s demos as products, I just put it all into one email for checking out in five minutes or less. Greg Isenberg 41:53\nI love and I\u0026rsquo;m a subscriber, my open rates 100%. It\u0026rsquo;s just it\u0026rsquo;s really exciting. It\u0026rsquo;s exciting to be seeing all these new tools coming out almost almost every day. Like it feels like almost every day, right? And just playing around with it. Like if I could recommend people do anything. founders, executives at startups, executives at large companies is just like, play with it. And then you\u0026rsquo;ll start going on walks or working out and you\u0026rsquo;ll be like, Oh, wow, here\u0026rsquo;s an idea for AI and then you can start, you know, take it from there. So, Ben\u0026rsquo;s bites, definitely, it helps get the juices flowing. So thank you for that. If you enjoyed this, please please give us a YouTube subscription or a a review on Spotify and Apple podcasts. It does make a big difference.
